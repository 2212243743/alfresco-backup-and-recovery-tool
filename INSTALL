REQUIREMENTS

For description and changelog see README file.

Alfresco BART needs Duplicity (Python backup tool). Install it or Alfresco BART won't work. Most Linux distributions have readymade Duplicity packages available. If you encounter errors using the distro's duplicity please double check if the version is outdated on http://duplicity.nongnu.org.

Please try using the latest stable Duplicity version (0.6.26) from the Duplicity website before filing bug reports. If you install Duplicity from the website's tarball check next "Requirements" before:
 -Python v2.6 or later
 -librsync v0.9.6 or later
 -GnuPG for encryption
 -fasteners 0.14.1 or later for concurrency locking
 -for scp/sftp -- python-paramiko and python-pycryptopp
 -for ftp -- lftp version 3.7.15 or later
 -Boto 2.0 or later for single-processing S3 or GCS access (default)
 -Boto 2.1.1 or later for multi-processing S3 access
 
Other Alfresco BART dependences are:
-mysqldump for MySQL backup
-pg_dump for PostgreSQL backup
-imp for Oracle backup

INSTALLATION

1. Create a GPG key for encryption support "gpg --gen-key", recommended.
2. Copy the files in src "alfresco-bart.*" to the "scripts" directory inside your Alfresco installation directory or simply use it from anywhere in your file system (anyways I recommend to install it in your Alfresco installation).
3. Check the executable permissions on "alfresco-bart.sh", it must be executable ("chmod +x alfresco-bart.sh").
4. Protect permissions for alfresco-bart.properties, it must be set as read only for the user who runs the backup, i.e. to assign read permission only for the owner type "chmod 400 alfresco-bart.properties".
5. Edit ALFBRT_PATH variable in alfresco-bart.sh, understand and configure all required options in alfresco-bart.properties.
6. Run "./alfresco-bart.sh" to get usage help
7. Add "0 5 * * * /path/to/alfresco-bart.sh backup" to the appropriate crontab if you want to run your backup daily at 5AM (after Alfresco's nightly backups and maintenance jobs). First time you run "alfresco-bart.sh backup" it will do a full backup then incremental backups as you configure in alfresco-bart.properties.
